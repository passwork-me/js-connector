## Compatibility Warning

**This JavaScript connector is compatible only with Passwork versions up to 6.x.** For Passwork 7.0 and newer, this connector will not function correctly due to API changes. Please migrate to the new official Python connector available at [https://github.com/passwork-me/passwork-python](https://github.com/passwork-me/passwork-python) for full compatibility with Passwork 7.0+. The JavaScript connector is no longer maintained and will not receive updates to support newer Passwork versions

## About the API
The Passwork API lets you retrieve, create, update passwords, folders and vaults. It is an easy way how you can integrate Passwork with your infrastructure. Use our Passwork JS Connector to make the integration smoother. The API operates behalf of the user whom API Key is used.

## Documentation

#### How to install
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/passwork-me/js-connector.git .
npm install
```

#### API Key

![alt text](./passwork.png)

- Sign in to your Passwork
- Menu â†’ API Settings
- Enter your authorization key and generate the API Key

Keep the API Key in secret. Use method `login(...)` to retrieve a temporary API Token.
The API Token is a session token. It lives while you are calling the API and then it gets expired and you will need to `login` again.
API Token Lifetime can be set up in your Passwork.
The API Token is stored in `passswork` instance under the hood and sent in HTTP Header. 


Check for all available methods in
[Passwork API Methods](./src/passwork-interface.js)

#### Open session

```JS
const Passwork = require('./src/passwork-api');
/** @type PassworkAPI */
const passwork = new Passwork("https://passwork/api/v4");
(async () => {
    await passwork.login("api-key");
    // or await passwork.login("api-key", "master password"); if you are using a client side encryption 

    // do what you need here

    await passwork.logout();
})();
```


A session lives for 10 mins (can be customized).
So you can perform multiple actions within one session without executing `login`.

### Examples
Get password by ID

```JS
const Passwork = require('./src/passwork-api');
const passwork = new Passwork("https://passwork/api/v4");
(async () => {
    await passwork.login("api-key");
    let password = await passwork.getPassword("password-id");
    await passwork.logout();
})();
```
